RAMA is a Spotify Application for visualizing and interacting with networks of music artists. For the original RAMA web application see [rama.inescporto.pt]

For now, I do not intend to make this application available on the Spotify App Store, so to run it you need to set it up first.


Installation
--------------
Tested on mac for now only.

Run the following commands from the command prompt (for mac):
```sh
$ mkdir ~/Spotify ; cd ~/Spotify
$ git clone https://github.com/carsy/rama-spotify.git
```

Alternatively, If you happen to have commandlinephobia (I get that every other month... might be a thing):

1. download the latest version of the app from [here]
2. extract the folder
3. create the Spotify folder if it doesn't exist already: "~/Spotify" (Mac OS X and Linux) or "My Documents\Spotify" (Windows).
4. copy the extracted folder to the Spotify folder.

Now open Spotify and type in the search bar:
```sh
spotify:app:rama-spotify
```
You should now be in the app and seeing a graph thingy.

### GNU/Linux Support

With no official Spotify Desktop Client release, there's nothing I can do about this. Try your luck with wine (playonlinux might be the best option).

[Releases]
----

[v0.1.0] - first release

It is still in alfa, so please bear with the lack of functionalities.
